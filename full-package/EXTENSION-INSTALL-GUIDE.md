## ❓ **Why Developer Mode for Now?**

**Developer mode is ONLY needed because:**
- Extension isn't published to Chrome Web Store yet
- Extension isn't signed with certificate
- This is normal for testing/development

**In production, users won't need developer mode if you:**
- Publish to Chrome Web Store, OR  
- Sign the extension with a certificate

## 🔧 **For Developers Only**

If you're testing/developing:
```bash
1. Clone/download the source code
2. Open chrome://extensions
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Load unpacked → select extension folder
5. Test and modify code
```
