# 🤖 AUTO-PLAY FEATURE - SIMPLE GUIDE

## What It Does

The bot **automatically plays the crash game for you**:
- Places bets every round
- Cashes out at your target (like 2x)
- Stops when you hit profit/loss limits

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Install the Extension
1. Load the extension in Chrome (see INSTALL.md)
2. Go to https://solpump.io
3. Connect your wallet

### Step 2: Configure Settings
Click the extension icon and go to "Auto-Play" tab:

**Settings:**
- **Bet Amount**: How much SOL to bet each game (e.g., 0.01)
- **Target Multiplier**: When to cash out (e.g., 2.0 = double your money)
- **Stop Loss**: Stop if you lose this much total (e.g., 0.1 SOL)
- **Take Profit**: Stop if you win this much total (e.g., 0.5 SOL)

### Step 3: Start Auto-Play
1. Click "▶️ Start Auto-Play"
2. Confirm you want to start
3. **The bot now plays automatically!**

### Step 4: Monitor
Watch the stats update in real-time:
- Games Played
- Win Rate %
- Total Bet
- Profit/Loss

### Step 5: Stop Anytime
Click "⏹️ Stop Auto-Play" to stop the bot.

## Example Settings

### **Conservative** (Safer, slower wins)
```
Bet Amount: 0.01 SOL
Target: 1.5x
Stop Loss: 0.05 SOL
Take Profit: 0.2 SOL
```

### **Moderate** (Balanced)
```
Bet Amount: 0.02 SOL
Target: 2.0x
Stop Loss: 0.1 SOL
Take Profit: 0.5 SOL
```

### **Aggressive** (Riskier, bigger wins)
```
Bet Amount: 0.05 SOL
Target: 3.0x
Stop Loss: 0.2 SOL
Take Profit: 1.0 SOL
```

## How It Works

1. **Waits for game to start** → Bot detects "betting open"
2. **Places bet** → Enters your bet amount and clicks "Bet"
3. **Monitors multiplier** → Watches the number go up (1.2x, 1.5x, 1.8x...)
4. **Cashes out at target** → Clicks "Cashout" when it hits your target
5. **Repeats** → Waits for next game and does it again

If the game crashes before your target → **You lose that bet**
If you cash out at target → **You win!**

## Troubleshooting

**Bot won't start:**
- Make sure you're on solpump.io
- Wallet must be connected
- Refresh the page and try again

**Bot not placing bets:**
- Check if betting is actually open
- Make sure you have enough SOL
- Try increasing the delay in settings

**Bot not cashing out:**
- Target might be too high (game crashes first)
- Try a lower target like 1.5x or 1.8x

**Stats not updating:**
- Refresh the extension popup
- Check browser console for errors

## Strategy Tips

1. **Start Small**: Test with 0.001 SOL first
2. **Lower Targets Win More**: 1.5x hits more often than 3.0x
3. **Set Strict Limits**: Don't chase losses
4. **Take Breaks**: Don't let it run for hours
5. **Track Your Stats**: Review win rate and adjust
